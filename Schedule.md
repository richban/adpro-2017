This schedule is **preliminary**. The final schedule will be published after the course is over.

stats: 10 weeks classes, 4 weeks project-like activities, 1 week meta (project demos, exam, etc) = 15 weeks
As the semester is 16 weeks, you get one week to recover :)

***
### Feb 2: 010 Introduction to Scala and functional programming 
* Basics of Scala, pure functions, loops, recursion, functions as values, parametric polymorphism, standard HOFs, anonymous functions)  
* **Read before class:** chapters 1-2 of [Chiusano, Bjarnason 2014] 
* Bring your laptop to class. Make sure that you have Scala ver. 2.12 or newer installed before the first class.  The official installation website for Scala is: http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads 
* IDE? If you wish so.  Andrzej uses Neovim, people use Emacs, Atom, Sublime.  Then some others use Eclipse (http://scala-ide.org/) or IntelliJ.  The course enforces no development environment.  Most projects are packaged as SBT projects (http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* Exercises for use in class: (git pull the project repo)

### Feb 9: 020 Algebraic Data Types
* Simple pure functional data structures (Scala traits, algebraic data types, lists, tuples, trees, variadic functions, variance, folding, companion objects, primary constructors)
* **Reading before class:** chapter 3 of [Chiusano, Bjarnason 2014]

### Feb 16: 030 Partial Computations
* Exceptions are not referentially transparent (exceptions vs values, partial functions, the Option data type, exception oriented API of Option, for comprehensions, Either)
* **Read before class:** chapter 4 of [Chiusano, Bjarnason 2014]
* [More information about Scala's for comprehensions](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/FAQ/yield.html)

### Feb 23: 040 Lazy Streams
* Lazy evaluation (strict and non-strict functions, call-by-value, call-by-name, lazy lists, infinite streams)
* **Read before class:** chapter 5 of [Chiusano, Bjarnason 2014]

### Mar 2: 050 State Monad. Guest Lecture. 
* 1st hour: State Monad
* 2nd hour: Guest speaker, Dr. Viet Yen Nguyen, CTO of [hypefactors.com](http://hypefactors.com)

### Mar 9: 060 Parallel Computations 

### Mar 16: 070 Property testing. Mini-project 1 kick-off 

### Mar 23: Mini project 1 work week
* no new class, instructors are available for support

### Mar 29: Mini project 1 hand-in deadline

### Mar 30: 080 Functional Design: Monoids, foldables, functors and monads in Scala
* This is the last time we use the textbook

### Apr 6: 090 Monadic Evaluators
* This week is based on reading a research paper. There will be no lecture, but instructors are available for support
* Solving exercises applying the knowledge from the course to implementing basic things from the paper, expressed in Haskell
* It relates your knowledge of monads, to knowledge of code evolvability and maintainability, and to knowledge of building interpreters.  A truly holistic experience!

### Apr 13: EASTER BREAK

### Apr 19: Deadline for homeworks 1-8  (until the monads chapter inclusive)
* This is the handin deadline for homeworks of classes until March 30 (inclusive).

### Apr 20: Mini-project 2 kick off
* [tentative] Guest Speaker: Natalie Schluter, IT University
* no new homework.  The first week to work on the project.

### Apr 27: Mini Project week
* no new homework.  The second week to work on the project.

### May 3: Deadline for handing in Mini-project 2 

### May 4: 100 Finger Trees (Advanced recursion, immutable data structures)
* **Master nad MSc students only**. 
* The classes are over for BSWU students

### May 11: 110 Asymmetric data lenses (purely functional modification of complex structured data)
* **MSc students only**.  
* The classes are over for BSWU and MSEN students 

### May 17: deadline for all remaining homeworks (monadic evaluators, finger trees, lenses)

### May 18: Project Demo Day and Exam preparation

### May 21: Final resubmission day for missing homeworks and failed projects
* please resubmit them as early as possible, we strive to mark things on the fly to avoid a congestion

### May 31: Written Exam
